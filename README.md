# Jammer 2 with Playlist

This project is a simple web-based music player that allows users to play multiple music tracks. It features a playlist, track navigation (next/previous), and audio controls such as play/pause, volume control, and seek bar. The player automatically advances to the next track when the current one finishes and updates the UI accordingly.

## Features

- **Playlist Support**: Displays a list of songs with track number, title, and artist.
- **Track Navigation**: Users can select any track from the playlist or use the next/previous buttons to navigate between songs. The player automatically loops to the first track when it reaches the end of the playlist.
- **Play/Pause Functionality**: Toggle between play and pause for the currently selected track.
- **Stop Functionality**: Stop playback and reset the track to the beginning.
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume slider with mute/unmute functionality.
- **Seek Bar**: Allows users to seek to a specific part of the track.
- **Track Information**: Displays the current song title, artist, and elapsed time.
- **Track Highlight**: Visually highlights the track that is currently being played.
- **Automatic Playback**: Automatically advances to the next track when the current one finishes.
